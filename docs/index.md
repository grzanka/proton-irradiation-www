Welcome to the main page of **Proton Irradiation Facility at IFJ**. We operate as part of the Krakow Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences. 


### Proton Irradiation Facility
We  perform irradiations with an energy of protons to 60 MeV with a wide range of beam intensity and various techniques of active and passive dosimetry at two irradiation stations. Parameters such as dose rate or proton beam flux are monitored during the experiments and recorded.

Our infrastructure allows us to irradiate various types of samples:  
- physical - testing the radiation hardness of materials or new detectors,  
- chemical - such as nanoparticles,  
- biological (containing living cells),  
- various types of electronics 
- including for the needs of the space industry.  

We invite our guests and clients to cooperate.
