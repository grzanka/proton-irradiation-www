Welcome to the **Proton Irradiation Station at IFJ** for industry and science. We operate as part of the Krakow Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences. 


### Proton Irradiation Station
We  perform irradiations with an energy of protons to 60 MeV with a wide range of beam intensity and various techniques of active and passive dosimetry at two irradiation stations. Parameters such as dose rate or proton beam flux are monitored during the experiments and recorded.

Our infrastructure allows us to irradiate various types of samples:  

 * various types of electronics, including for the needs of the space industry, 
 * physical - testing the radiation hardness of materials or new detectors,  
 * chemical - such as nanoparticles,  
 * biological (containing living cells).

We invite our guests and clients to cooperate.
