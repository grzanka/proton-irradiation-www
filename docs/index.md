## Proton Irradiation Station for industry and science

The proton irradiation station was developed at the facility that was formerly used for the proton therapy of eye cancer. The beamline was utilised in several international projects ([INSPIRE](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/730983/reporting), [EURO-LABS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101057511/reporting)) and for the commercial irradiation of electronics for the space industry. 

We perform irradiations with an energy of protons up to 60 MeV with a wide range of beam intensities and field sizes.
We apply various techniques of active and passive dosimetry at two beamlines. 
Parameters such as dose rate or proton beam flux are monitored during the experiments and recorded.

Our infrastructure allows us to irradiate various types of samples:

 * various types of electronics, including for the needs of the space industry, 
 * physical - testing the radiation hardness of materials or new detectors,  
 * chemical - such as nanoparticles,  
 * biological (containing living cells).

We invite our guests and clients to cooperate.
We operate as part of the [Krakow Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN)](https://www.ifj.edu.pl/en/index.php).
